# MinesweeperBattleshipGame
(MBG) for short
// Creating a game that functions similarly to the game batttleships. A grid will have hidden ships as well as bombs and the user must try to pick 
//and guess safe squares while finding the hidden battleships. They get 3 lives and once they run out, the game ends. 

//First update to be pushed from local computers will have basic grid implimentation and layout(hopefully).
